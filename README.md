This repository contains a python implementation of the paper [Lazy Random Walks for Superpixel Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6725608). The repository provides a minimal GUI built using the [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library. The GUI exposes various parameters which can be used to tweak the quality of the results obtained. A brief overview of all the parameters and their usage has been given below. For more details about them please refer to the original paper.

## Parameters

- **Seed Count**: The seed count refers to the total number of superpixels we want to have in the final image.

- **Beta**: Beta is the Gaussian parameter. It dictates how much the intensity difference between neighbouring pixels affects the result.

- **Lazy Parameter**: Lazy parameter is the probability with which the random walk algorithm leaves the node it currently is on. That is it stays on the same node with probability ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?1-\alpha) where ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\alpha) is the lazy parameter.

- **Threshold**: Threshold is the value of area after which a split in a superpixel will happen. The area function used in the paper is the [Local Binary Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_binary_patterns) function which effectively measures the texture content of a region.

- **Max Iterations**: Max iterations refer to the maximum number of times the LRW and area optimisation algorithm will be run.

## Results

We ran our algorithm on the [Berkely Segmentation Dataset (BSDS300)](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/) and have provided the results in a [OneDrive folder](https://iiitaphyd-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dipanwita_g_research_iiit_ac_in/Eiz_Qq3-QR1HhCxKDPsJu1EBKhNC-0FcZHheM0m6dKpSCw?e=TUX3rb). We also performed qualitative and quantitative comparisons of our algorithm with several other well known algorithms such as Random Walk, Compact Watershed and SLIC.

## Installation

To run the GUI, first install the python dependencies defined in [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively if you use NixOS or the Nix package manager you can easily enter a shell provisioned with the needed dependencies using:

```bash
nix-shell
```

Once the dependencies have been installed you can run the GUI using:

```bash
python main.py
```
